# Desktop Cleaner
Desktop Cleaner is a Python script designed to organize files on your desktop into specific folders based on their file extensions and keywords found in their names. Additionally, it provides an option to back up these organized folders to Google Drive.

## Features
- File Organization: Automatically categorizes files on your desktop into folders such as Documents, Images, Videos, Audio, Archives, Data, and Others based on their file extensions.
- Keyword-Based Sorting: Sorts files further into subdirectories within each category based on keywords extracted from their names. This is done using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), which is a natural langugage processing library.
- Google Drive Backup: Option to back up the organized folders to Google Drive through the Google API.
